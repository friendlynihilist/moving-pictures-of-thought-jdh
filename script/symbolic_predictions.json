Structural Analysis\n*   **The Line of Identity:** There is a single heavy line that branches. \n*   **Outermost Position:** The \"head\" of the line is attached to the word **\"man\"** on the blank sheet (0 cuts). According to the rules, because the outermost part of the line is in an even number of cuts (0), it represents an existential quantifier: **\"There is a...\"** or **\"Some...\"**\n*   **The Cut (Negation):** There is one closed curve (cut). Inside this cut, the line branches to two predicates: **\"man\"** and **\"wounded\"**.\n*   **The Relationship:** The line originates outside (as a \"man\") and passes into the cut to connect to \"man\" and \"wounded\" again.\n\n### 2. Logical Translation\nIn Peirce’s system, a line crossing into a cut from the outside represents a \"conditional\" or \"negated\" property for that specific individual.\n\n*   **Outside the cut:** There is a man. $\\exists x (Man(x) \\dots)$\n*   **Inside the cut:** ...it is NOT the case that [this same individual is a man AND is wounded]. $\\dots \\neg (Man(x) \\land Wounded(x))$\n\nHowever, in standard Existential Graph interpretation, when a line originates on the sheet and enters a cut to connect to predicates, it reads as: **\"There is some man who is not [both man and wounded].\"** Since the individual is already established as a man, the internal \"man\" label is redundant for the natural language reading.\n\n### 3. Natural Language Reading\nThe most precise natural language reading is:\n\n**\"Some man is not wounded.\"**\n\n***\n\n**Technical Breakdown:**\n*   **Quantifier:** \"Some\" (because the line starts on the 0-level sheet).\n*   **Subject:** \"man\" (the predicate on the 0-level sheet).\n*   **Negation Scope:** The property of being \"wounded\" is inside the cut, while the identity of the individual is established outside. This creates the \"Some X is not Y\" pattern.",
